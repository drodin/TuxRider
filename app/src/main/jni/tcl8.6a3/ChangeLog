	error message. [Bug 2151707]

	* generic/tclVar.c:	Revised implementation of TclObjVarErrMsg so
	that error message construction does not disturb an existing
	iPtr->errorInfo that may be in progress.

2008-10-07  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/binary.n: Added better documentation of the [binary encode] and

	* doc/FileSystem.3:     CONSTified Tcl_FSFileAttrStringsProc
	* generic/tclFCmd.c:    and tclpFileAttrStrings. This allows
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:  FileSystems to report their attributes
	* generic/tclTest.c:    as const strings, without worrying that
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c:   Tcl modifies them (which Tcl should not
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c:     do anyway, but the API didn't indicate that)
	* generic/tcl.decls
	* generic/tclDecls.h:   regenerated
	* generic/tcl.h:        Make sure that if CONST84 is defined as empty,

	TIP #331 IMPLEMENTATION

	* doc/lset.n:
	* generic/tclListObj.c (TclLsetFlat):

	* generic/tclCompile.h   values of TclGetAuxDataType and
	* generic/tclExecute.c   TclGetInstructionTable
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:		regenerated
	This change complies with TIP #27 (even though it only involves
	internal function, so this is not even necessary).

2008-10-05  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclIndexObj.c (TclInitPrefixCmd): Make the [tcl::prefix]
	into an exported command. [Bug 2144595]

	yet. [Bug 2059262]

2008-10-04  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOOInfo.c (GetClassFromObj): Factor out the code to parse
	a Tcl_Obj and get a class. Also make result handling hygienic.

	* generic/tclDecls.h:	regenerated
	This change complies with TIP #27.

2008-10-03  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tests/stack.test:
	* unix/tclUnixTest.c: Removed test command teststacklimit and the
	corresponding constraint: it is not needed with NRE

	TIP #195 IMPLEMENTATION

	* generic/tclIndexObj.c (TclGetIndexFromObjList, PrefixMatchObjCmd)

	* generic/tcl.h (Tcl_ArgvInfo):	Added function for simple parsing of
	* doc/ParseArgs.3 (new file):	optional arguments to commands. Still
	needs tests and the like. [FRQ 1446696] Note that some of the type

	they better reflect codified good practice for argument order.

2008-10-02  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tests/info.test (info-23.3): Updated output of the test to handle
	the NRE-enabled eval and the proper propagation of location

	numbers as level argument. [Bug 2134049]

	* tests/info.test (info-22.8): Made pattern for file containing
	tcltest less specific to accept both .tcl and .tm variants of the file
	during matching. [Bug 2129828]

2008-10-02  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	TIP #330 IMPLEMENTATION

	* generic/tcl.h:	Remove the "result" and "freeProc" fields
	* generic/tclBasic.c:	from the default public declaration of the
	* generic/tclResult.c:	Tcl_Interp struct.  Code should no longer
	* generic/tclStubLib.c:	be accessing these fields.  Access can be
	* generic/tclTest.c:	restored by defining USE_INTERP_RESULT, but
	* generic/tclUtil.c:	that should only be a temporary migration aid.

	* doc/define.n, doc/ooInfo.n, benchmarks/cps.tcl:
	* tests/oo.test (oo-26.*): Allow the declaration of the common
	variables used in methods of a class or object. These are then mapped
	in using a variable resolver. This makes many class declarations much
	simpler overall, encourages good usage of variable names, and also
	boosts speed a bit.

	* generic/tclOOMethod.c (TclOOGetMethodBody): Factor out the code to
	get the body of a procedure-like method. Reduces the amount of "poking
	inside the abstraction" that is done by the introspection code.

	* library/init.tcl: export min and max commands from the mathfunc
	namespace. [Bug 2116053]

2008-09-16  Joe Mistachkin  <joe@mistachkin.com>

	substitution at level 0.

2008-09-16  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Move TclResetCancellation to be called on
	returning to level 0, as opposed to it being called on starting a
	command at level 0. Add a call on returning via Tcl_EvalObjEx to fix
	[Bug 2114165].

2008-09-10  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclListObj.c (Tcl_ListObjGetElements): Make this list->dict
	transformation - encountered when using [foreach] with dicts - not as
	expensive as it was before. Spotted by Kieran Elby and reported on
	tcl-core.

2008-09-08  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* tests/append.test, appendComp.test, cmdAH.test: Use the powers of
	tcltest2 to make these files simpler.

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclCompileTokens):
	* generic/tclExecute.c (CompileExprObj): Fix a perf bug (found by Alex
	Ferrieux) where some variables in the LVT where not being accessed by

	* compat/dirent2.h:	to support a TCL_NO_DEPRECATED build.
	* compat/dlfcn.h:
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:

	* generic/tcl.h:	Removed the conditional #define of
	_ANSI_ARGS_ that would support pre-prototype C compilers.  Since
	_ANSI_ARGS_ is no longer used in tclDecls.h, it's clear no one
	compiling against Tcl 8.5 headers is making use of a -DNO_PROTOTYPES
	configuration.

2008-09-02  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* tests/socket.test: Rewrote so as to use tcltest2 better.

2008-09-01  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tests/unsupported.test:

2008-09-01  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOO.c (ObjectRenamedTrace): Arrange for only methods that
	involve callbacks into the Tcl interpreter to be skipped when the
	interpreter is being torn down. Allows the semantics of destructors in
	a dying interpreter to be more useful when they're implemented in C.

2008-08-29  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Ensure that all TclOO headers get installed.
	* win/Makefile.in:  [Bug 2082299]

2008-08-27  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/tclvars.n, doc/library.n: Ensured that these two manual pages
	properly cross-reference each other. Issue reported on Tcler's Chat.

2008-08-26  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (InfoCoroutine):
	* tests/unsupported.test: New command that returns the FQN of the

	unsupported, but is designed to become a subcommand of [info]

2008-08-23  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (NRInterpCoroutine): Store the caller's eePtr,
	stop assuming the coroutine is invoked from the same execEnv where it
	was created.

2008-08-24  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (TclNRForeachCmd): Converted the [foreach]
	command to have an NRE-aware non-compiled implementation. Part of the
	[Bug 2017632] project. Also restructured the code so as to manage its
	temporary memory more efficiently.

2008-08-23  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	  Removed unused var; fixed function pointer
	* generic/tclOOInt.h:	  declarations (why did gcc start complaining
	* generic/tclOOMethod.c:  all of a sudden?)
	* generic/tclProc.c:

2008-08-23  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h (EnsembleImplMap): Added extra field to make it

	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* generic/tclExecute.c: Set special errocodes: COROUTINE_BUSY,
	COROUTINE_CANT_YIELD, COROUTINE_ILLEGAL_YIELD.

2008-08-22  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	*** 8.6a2 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

	* changes:	Updates for 8.6a2 release.

	* generic/tcl.h:	Drop use of USE_COMPAT85_CONST. That added
	indirection without value. Use -DCONST86="" to engage source compat
	support for code written for 8.5 headers.

	* generic/tclUtil.c (TclReToGlob):	Added missing set of the
	*exactPtr value to really fix [Bug 2065115]. Also avoid possible
	DString overflow.
	* tests/regexpComp.test:	Correct duplicate test names.

2008-08-21  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	  Previous fix, now done right.
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* tests/unsupported.test:

2008-08-21  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/regexp.test, tests/regexpComp.test: Correct re2glob ***=
	* generic/tclUtil.c (TclReToGlob):	    translation from exact
	to anywhere-in-string match. [Bug 2065115]

2008-08-21  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h:	Reduced the use of CONST86 and eliminated
	* generic/tcl.decls:	the use of CONST86_RETURN to support source
	code compatibility with Tcl 8.5 on those public routines passing
	(Tcl_Filesystem *), (Tcl_Timer *), and (Tcl_Objtype *) values which
	have been const-ified. What remains is the minimum configurability
	needed to support code written for pre-8.6 headers via the new
	-DUSE_COMPAT85_CONST compiler directive.
	*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

	* generic/tclDecls.h:   make genstubs

2008-08-21  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:   Fix the cmdFrame level count in
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c:   coroutines. Fix small bug on coroutine
	* generic/tclInt.h:	rewind.

2008-08-21  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclProc.c (Tcl_DisassembleObjCmd): Added ability to
	disassemble TclOO methods. The code to do this is very ugly.

2008-08-21  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclOOMethod.c: Added casts to make MSVC happy
	* generic/tclBasic.c:

2008-08-20  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOO.c (AllocObject): Suppress compilation of commands in
	the namespace allocated for each object.
	* generic/tclOOMethod.c (PushMethodCallFrame): Restore some of the
	hackery that makes calling methods of classes fast. Fixes performance
	problem introduced by the fix of [Bug 2037727].

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclCompileScript):    Allow the suppression of
	* generic/tclInt.h (NS_SUPPRESS_COMPILATION): compilation of commands
	* generic/tclNamesp.c (Tcl_CreateNamespace):  from a namespace or its
	children.

2008-08-20  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclTest.c (TestconcatobjCmd):	Fix use of internal-only
	TclInvalidateStringRep macro. [Bug 2057479]

2008-08-17  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	   Implementation of [coroutine] and [yield]

	* generic/tclUtil.c (Tcl_ConcatObj):
	* tests/util.test (util-4.7):
	Fix [Bug 1447328]; the original "fix" turned Tcl_ConcatObj() into a
	hairy monster. This was exposed by [Bug 2055782]. Additionally,
	Tcl_ConcatObj could corrupt its input under certain conditions!

	*** NASTY BUG FIXED ***

2008-08-16  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Better cmdFrame management

2008-08-14  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclDTrace.d:			method & class/object info.

	* generic/tclCompile.h:		Add support for debug logging of DTrace
	* generic/tclBasic.c:		'proc', 'cmd' and 'inst' probes (does
					_not_ require a platform with DTrace).

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (TclInfoFrame):	Check fPtr->line before
						dereferencing as line info may
						not exists when TclInfoFrame()
						is called from a DTrace probe.

	* tests/fCmd.test (fCmd-6.23):	Made result matching robust when test
					workdir and /tmp are not on same FS.

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c:		Remove unused TclpThreadGetStackSize()

2008-08-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>S

	* generic/tclOOMethod.c (PushMethodCallFrame):	Added missing check
	for bytecode validity. [Bug 2037727]

	* generic/tclProc.c (TclProcCompileProc):	On recompile of a
	proc, clear away any entries on the CompiledLocal list from the
	previous compile. This will prevent compile of temporary variables in
	the proc body from growing the localCache arbitrarily large.

	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc:

2008-08-11  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* library/tm.tcl: Added a 'package provide' command to the generated
	ifneeded scripts of Tcl Modules, for early detection of conflicts
	between the version specified through the file name and a 'provide'
	command in the module implementation, if any. Note that this change
	also now allows Tcl Modules to not provide a 'provide' command at all,
	and declaring their version only through their filename.

	* generic/tclProc.c (Tcl_ProcObjCmd): Fixed memory leak triggered by
	* tests/proc.test: procbody::test::proc. See [Bug 2043636]. Added a
	test case demonstrating the leak before the fix. Fixed a few spelling
	errors in test descriptions as well.

2008-08-11  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/http/http.tcl:	Bump http version to 2.7.1 to account
	* library/http/pkgIndex.tcl:	for [Bug 2046486] bug fix. This
	* unix/Makefile.in:		release of http now requires a
	* win/Makefile.in:		dependency on Tcl 8.5 to be able to
	* win/makefile.bc:		use the unsigned formats in the
	* win/makefile.vc:		[binary scan] command.

2008-08-11  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/http/http.tcl: CRC field from zlib data should be treated as
	unsigned for 64bit support. [Bug 2046846]

2008-08-10  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclProc.c: Completely removed ProcCompileProc, which was a
	fix for [Bug 1482718]. This is not needed at least since varReform,
	where the local variable data at runtime is read from the CallFrame
	and/or the LocalCache.

2008-08-09  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Slight cleanup

	* generic/tclInt.h:

2008-08-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>S

	* generic/tclOO.c:	Revised TclOO's check for an interp being
	deleted during handling of object command deletion. The old code was
	relying on documented features of command delete traces that do not in
	fact work. [Bug 2039178]

	* tests/oo.test (oo-26.*):	Added tests that demonstrate failure
	of TclOO to check for various kinds of invalid bytecode during method
	dispatch. [Bug 2037727]

2008-08-06  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c (TclLookupSimpleVar): Fix bug that the core could
	not trigger before TclOO: the number of locals was being read from the
	Proc, which can under some circumstance be out of sync with the
	localCache's. Found by dgp while investigating [Bug 2037727].

	* library/init.tcl (::unknown): Removed the [namespace inscope]
	hack that was maintained for Itcl

	*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY *** for Itcl
	Itcl users will need a new release with Itcl's [Patch 2040295], or
	else load the tiny script in that patch by themselves (rewrite
	::unknown). Note that it is a script-only patch.

2008-08-05  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c: Streamline async connect logic [Patch 1994512]

2008-08-05  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Fix for [Bug 2038069] by dgp.
	* tests/execute.test:

2008-08-04  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tests/nre.test: Added tests for [if], [while] and [for]. A test
	for [foreach] has been added and marked as knownbug, awaiting for it
	to be NR-enabled.

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	   Made atProcExit commands run
	* generic/tclCompile.h:	   unconditionally, streamlined
	* generic/tclExecute.c:	   atProcExit/tailcall processing in TEBC.
	* generic/tclProc.c:

	fallback to direct evaluation of commands in a compiled script.
	[Bug 2037338]

2008-08-03  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	   New unsupported command atProcExit that
	* generic/tclCompile.h:	   shares the implementation with tailcall.
	* generic/tclExecute.c:	   Fixed a segfault in tailcalls. Tests added.
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclInterp.c:
	* generic/tclNamesp.c:
	* tests/unsupported.test:

2008-08-02  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tests/NRE.test (removed):	Migrated tests to standard locations,
	* tests/nre.test (new):		separating core functionality from the
	* tests/unsupported.test (new):	experimental commands.

2008-08-01  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/Exit.3:			Do not call Tcl_Finalize implicitly
	* generic/tclEvent.c:		on DLL_PROCESS_DETACH as it may lead
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (DllMain):	to issues and the user should be
	explicitly calling Tcl_Finalize before unloading regardless. Clarify
	the docs to note the explicit need in embedded use.

2008-08-01  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Revised timing of the CmdFrame stack management
	* tests/info.test:	in TclEvalEx so that the CmdFrame will still
	be on the stack at the time Tcl_LogCommandInfo is called to append
	another level of -errorinfo information. Sets the stage to add file
	and line data to the stack trace. Added test to check that [info
	frame] functioning remains unchanged by the revision.

2008-07-31  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tests/NRE.test:  Replaced all deep-recursing tests by shallower
	tests that actually measure the C-stack depth. This makes them
	bearable again (even under memdebug) and avoid crashing on failure.

	* generic/tclBasic.c:   NR-enabling [catch], [if] and [for] and
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:   [while] (the script, not the tests)
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* tests/NRE.test:

	* generic/tclBasic.c:   Moved the few remaining defs from tclNRE.h to
	* generic/tclDictObj.c: tclInt.h, eliminated inclusion of tclNRE.h
	* generic/tclExecute.c: everywhere.
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclInterp.c:
	* generic/tclNRE.h (removed):
	* generic/tclNamesp.c:
	* generic/tclOOBasic.c:
	* generic/tclOOInt.h:
	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* generic/tclTest.c:
	* unix/Makefile.in:

2008-07-30  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	 Improved tailcalls.
	* generic/tclCompile.h:
	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* generic/tclTest.c:
	* tests/NRE.test:

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclNREvalObjEx): New comments and code reorg
	to clarify what is happening.

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Guard against the value of iPtr->evalFlags
	changing between the times where TEOV and TEOV_exception run. Thanks
	dgp for catching this.

2008-07-29  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tests/NRE.test: New tests that went MIA in the NRE revamping

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Clean up
	* generic/tclNRE.h:
	* generic/tclExecute.c:

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Made use of the thread's alloc cache stored in
	* generic/tclInt.h:	the ekeko at interp creation to avoid hitting
	* generic/tclNRE.h:	the TSD each time an NRE callback is pushed or
	* generic/tclThreadAlloc.c: pulled; the approach is suitably general
	to extend to every other obj allocation where an interp is know; this
	is left for some other time, requires a lot of grunt work.

	* generic/tclExecute.c:  Fix [Bug 2030670] that cause TclStackRealloc
	to panic on rare corner cases. Thx ajpasadyn for diagnose and patch.

	* generic/tcl.decls:	 Completely revamped NRE implementation, with
	* generic/tclBasic.c:	 (almost) unchanged API.
	* generic/tclCompile.h:
	* generic/tclExecute.c:	 TEBC will require a bit of a facelift, but
	* generic/tclInt.decls:	 TEOV at least looks great now. There are new
	* generic/tclInt.h:	 tests (incomplete!) to verify that execution
	* generic/tclInterp.c:	 is indeed in the same TEBC instance, at the
	* generic/tclNRE.h:	 same level in all stacks involved. Tailcalls
	* generic/tclNamesp.c:	 are still a bit leaky, still deserving to be
	* generic/tclOOBasic.c:	 in tcl::unsupported.
	* generic/tclOOMethod.c:
	* generic/tclProc.c:	 Uninit'd var warnings in TEBC with -O2, no
	* generic/tclTest.c:	 warnings otherwise.

2008-07-28  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* doc/FileSystem.3:		CONSTified many functions using
	* generic/tcl.decls:		Tcl_FileSystem which all are supposed
	* generic/tclDecls.h:		to be a constant, but this was not
	* generic/tclFileSystem.h:	reflected in the API: Tcl_FSData,
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:		Tcl_FSGetInternalRep, Tcl_FSRegister,
	* generic/tclPathObj.c:		Tcl_FSNewNativePath, Tcl_FSUnregister,
	* generic/tclTest.c:		Tcl_FSGetFileSystemForPath ...
	This change complies with TIP #27.
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***

2008-07-28  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Added missing ref count when creating an empty
	string as path (TclEvalEx). In 8.4 the missing code caused panics in
	the testsuite. It doesn't in 8.5. I am guessing that the code path
	with the missing the incr-refcount is not invoked any longer. Because
	the bug in itself is certainly the same.

2008-07-27  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOOMethod.c (PushMethodCallFrame): Remove hack that should
	have gone when this code was merged into Tcl.

2008-07-27  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* doc/Object.3:		CONSTified 3 functions using Tcl_ObjType
	* doc/ObjectType.3:	which all are supposed to be a constant, but
	* generic/tcl.decls:	this was not reflected in the API:
	* generic/tcl.h:	Tcl_RegisterObjType, Tcl_ConvertToType,
	* generic/tclDecls.h:	Tcl_GetObjType
	* generic/tclObj.c:	Introduced a CONST86_RETURN, so extensions
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c: which use Tcl_ObjType directly can be
	* generic/tclOOMethod.c: modified to compile against both Tcl 8.5 and
	* generic/tclTestobj.c:	Tcl 8.6. tclDecls.h regenerated
	This change complies with TIP #27.
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***

2008-07-25  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* test/info.test: More work on singleTestInterp usability. [1605269]

	* tests/info.test: Tests 38.* added, exactly testing the tracking of
	location for uplevel scripts. Resolved merge conflict on info-37.0,
	switched !singleTestInterp constraint to glob matching instead. Ditto
	info-22.8, removed constraint, more glob matching, and reduced the
	depth of the stack we check. More is coming, right now I want to
	commit the bug fixes.

	* tests/oo.test: Updated oo-22.1 for expanded location tracking.

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclInitCompileEnv): Reorganized the
	initialization of the #280 location information to match the flow in
	TclEvalObjEx to get more absolute contexts.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclEvalObjEx): Added missing cleanup of extended
	location information.

2008-07-25  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/info.test (info-37.0): Add !singleTestInterp constraint;
	(info-22.8, info-23.0): switch to glob matching to avoid sensitivity
	to tcltest.tcl line number changes, remove knownBug constraint, fix
	expected result. [Bug 1605269]

2008-07-24  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* doc/Notifier.3:      CONSTified 4 functions in the Notifier which
	* doc/Thread.3:	       all have a Tcl_Time* in it which is supposed
	* generic/tcl.decls:   to be a constant, but this was not reflected
	* generic/tcl.h:       reflected in the API:
	* generic/tclDecls.h:	    Tcl_SetTimer, Tcl_WaitForEvent,
	* generic/tclNotify.c:	    Tcl_ConditionWait, Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime
	* macosx/tclMacOSXNotify.c:
	* generic/tclThread.c: Introduced a CONST86, so extensions which have
	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c: have their own Notifier (are there any?) can
	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c:  can be modified to compile against both Tcl
	* win/tclWinNotify.c:  Tcl 8.5 and Tcl 8.6
	* win/tclWinThrd.c:    Regenerated tclDecls.h with "make stubs".
	This change complies with TIP #27
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***

2008-07-23  Alexandre Ferrieux	<ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/lrange.test: Added relative speed test to check for lrange
	in-place optimization committed 2008-06-30.
	* tests/binary.test: Added relative speed test to check for pure byte
	array CONCAT1 optimization committed 2008-06-30.

2008-07-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tests/info.test: Reordered the tests to have monotonously increasing
	numbers.

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Modified TclArgumentGet to reject pure lists
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c: immediately, without search. Reworked setup of
	* generic/tclCompile.c: eoFramePtr, doesn't need the line information,
	* tests/info.test: more sensible to have everything on line 1 when
	eval'ing a pure list. Updated the users of the line information to
	special case this based on the frame type (i.e.
	TCL_LOCATION_EVAL_LIST). Added a testcase demonstrating the new
	behaviour.

2008-07-23  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (GetCommandSource): added comment with
	explanation and warning for waintainers.

2008-07-22  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclCompile.c: Made the new TclEnterCmdWordIndex static, and
	* generic/tclCompile.h: ansified.

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Ansified the new functions. Added missing
	function comments.

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Reworked the handling of bytecode literals for
	* generic/tclCompile.c: #280 to fix the abysmal performance for deep
	* generic/tclCompile.h: recursion, replaced the linear search through
	* generic/tclExecute.c: the whole stack with another hashtable and
	* generic/tclInt.h: simplified the data structure used by the compiler
	by using an array instead of a hashtable. Incidentially this also
	fixes the memory leak reported via [Bug 2024937].

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	 Added numLevels field to CommandFrame, let
	* generic/tclExecute.c:	 GetCommandSource use it. This solves [Bug
	* generic/tclInt.h:	 2017146]. Thx dgp for the analysis.

2008-07-21  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Extended the existing TIP #280 system (info
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c: frame), added the ability to track the absolute
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c: location of literal procedure arguments, and
	* generic/tclCompile.c: making this information available to uplevel
	* generic/tclCompile.h: eval, and siblings. This allows proper
	* generic/tclInterp.c: tracking of absolute location through custom
	* generic/tclInt.h: (Tcl-coded) control structures based on uplevel,
	* generic/tclNamesp.c: etc.
	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* tests/info.test:

	* generic/tclFCmd.c:  Inodes on windows are unreliable. [Bug 2015723]
	* tests/winFCmd.test: test rename with inode collision

2008-07-21  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tcl.decls:	  Changed the implementation of
	* generic/tclBasic.c:	  [namespace import]; removed
	* generic/tclDecls.h:	  Tcl_NRObjProc, replaced with
	* generic/tclExecute.c:	  Tcl_NRCmdSwap (proposed public
	* generic/tclInt.h:	  NRE API). This should fix
	* generic/tclNRE.h:	  [Bug 582506].
	* generic/tclNamesp.c:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	 NRE: enabled calling NR commands
	* generic/tclExecute.c:	 from the callbacks. Completely
	* generic/tclInt.h:	 redone tailcall implementation
	* generic/tclNRE.h:	 using the new feature. [Bug 2021489]
	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* tests/NRE.test:

2008-07-20  Kevin B. Kenny  <kenykb@acm.org>

	* tests/fileName.test: Repaired the failing test fileName-15.7 from
	dkf's commit earlier today.

2008-07-20  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclDictObj.c (SetDictFromAny): Make the list->dict
	transformation a bit more efficient; modern dicts are ordered and so
	we can round-trip through lists without needing the string rep at all.
	* generic/tclListObj.c (SetListFromAny): Make the dict->list
	transformation not lossy of internal representations and hence more
	efficient. [Bug 2008248] (ajpasadyn) but using a more efficient patch.

	* tests/fileName.test: Revise to reduce the obscurity of tests. In
	particular, all tests should now produce informative messages on
	failure and the quantity of [catch]-based obscurity is now greatly
	reduced; non-erroring is now checked for directly.

2008-07-19  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* tests/env.test: Add LANG to the list of variables that are not
	touched by the environment variable tests, so that subprocesses can
	get their system encoding correct.

	* tests/exec.test, tests/env.test: Rewrite so that non-ASCII
	characters are not used in the final comparison. Part of fixing [Bug
	1513659].

2008-07-18  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	 Optimization: replace calls to

2008-07-18  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tests/NRE.test:  Added basic tests for deep TclOO calls

	* generic/tclOOBasic.c (TclOO_Object_Eval, FinalizeEval): NRE-enable
	the oo::object.eval method.

2008-07-18  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclDictObj.c (DictWithCmd, DictUpdateCmd): fix refcounting
	bugs that caused crashes [Bug 2017857].

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclNREvalObjEx): streamline the management of
	the command frame (opt).

2008-07-17  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclDictObj.c (DictWithCmd, FinalizeDictWith): Split the
	implementation of [dict with] so that it works with NRE.
	(DictUpdateCmd, FinalizeDictUpdate): Similarly for the non-compiled
	version of [dict update].

2008-07-16  George Peter Staplin <georgeps@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinThrd.c: Test for TLS_OUT_OF_INDEXES to make certain that

2008-07-16  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOO.c, generic/tclOOInt.h, generic/tclOOBasic.c:
	* generic/tclOOCall.c, generic/tclOOMethod.c: NRE-enable the TclOO
	implementation in Tcl. No change to public APIs, except that method
	implementations can now be NRE-aware if they choose (which normal
	methods and forwards are). On the other hand, callers of
	TclOOInvokeObject (which is only in the internal stub table) will need
	to deal with the fact that it's only safe to call inside an NRE-aware
	context.
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***

2008-07-15  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tests/NRE.test:	Better constraint for testing the existence of
	* tests/stack.test:	teststacklimit, to insure that the test suite
				runs under tclsh.

	* generic/tclParse.c: fixing incomplete reversion of "fix" for [Bug
	2017583], missing TclResetCancellation call.

2008-07-15  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_CancelEval): Fix blunder. [Bug 2018603]

	* doc/DictObj.3: Fix error in example. [Bug 2016740]

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (EnsembleUnknownCallback): Factor out some of
	the more complex parts of the ensemble code to make it easier to
	understand and hence to permit tighter compilation of code on the
	critical path.

2008-07-14  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclParse.c: Reverting the "fix" for [Bug 2017583], numLevel
	* tests/parse.test:   management and TclInterpReady check seems to be
			      necessary after all.

2008-07-14  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclProc.c (TclNRApplyObjCmd, TclObjInterpProcCore):
	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclNR_AddCallback, TclEvalObjv_NR2):
	* generic/tclNRE.h (TEOV_callback): Change the callback storage type
	to use an array, so guaranteeing correct inter-member spacing and
	memory layout.

2008-07-14  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c:	 Remove unneeded TclInterpReady calls
	* generic/tclParse.c:

	* generic/tclBasic.c.:	 Embedded Tcl_Canceled() calls into
	* generic/tclExecute.c:	 TclInterpReady().
	* generic/tclParse.c:

	* generic/tclVar.c: fix error message

	* generic/tclParse.c: remove unnecessary numLevel management
	* tests/parse.test:   [Bug 2017583]

	* generic/tclBasic.c.:	 NRE left too many calls to
	* generic/tclExecute.c:	 TclResetCancellation lying around: it
	* generic/tclProc.c:	 only needs to be called prior to any
				 iPtr->numLevels++. Thanks mistachkin.

	* generic/tclBasic.c: TclResetCancellation() calls were misplaced
	(merge mishap); stray //. Thanks patthoyts.

	* generic/tclInt.h: the new macros TclSmallAlloc and TclSmallFree
	were badly defined under mem debugging [Bug 2017240] (thx das)

	* tests/interp.test:	 Fixed numLevel counting.
	* tests/parse.test:

	* generic/tclGet.c:	Corrected out of date comments and removed
	* generic/tclInt.decls:	internal routine TclGetLong() that's no
	longer used. If an extension is using this from the internal stubs
	table, it can shift to the public routine Tcl_GetLongFromObj() or

2008-07-08  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/CrtInterp.3: Tighten up the descriptions of behaviour to make

2008-07-07  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (InfoFrameCmd): Fixed unsafe idiom of setting

2008-07-03  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIORChan.c (InvokeTclMethod): Fixed the memory leak
	reported in [Bug 1987821]. Thanks to Miguel for the report and Don
	Porter for tracking the cause down.

2008-07-03  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/package.tcl:	Removed [file readable] testing from
	[tclPkgUnknown] and friends. We find out soon enough whether a file is
	readable when we try to [source] it, and not testing before allows us
	to workaround the bugs on some common filesystems where [file
	readable] lies to us. [Patch 1969717]

2008-07-01  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/regc_nfa.c (duptraverse): Impose a maximum stack depth on
	the single most recursive part of the RE engine. The actual maximum
	may need tuning, but that needs a system with a small stack to carry
	out. [Bug 1905562]

	* tests/string.test: Eliminate non-ASCII characters from the actual

2008-06-23  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPathObj.c: Fixed bug in Tcl_GetTranslatedPath() when
	operating on the "Special path" variant of the "path" Tcl_ObjType
	intrep. A full normalization was getting done, in particular, coercing
	relative paths to absolute, contrary to what the function of producing
	the "translated path" is supposed to do. [Bug 1972879]

2008-06-20  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes:	Updates for 8.6a1 release.

	* generic/tclInterp.c:	Fixed completely boneheaded mistake that

	observable in the [clock] command itself.

2008-06-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (TclInfoFrame): Moved the code looking up the
	* tests/info.test: information for key 'proc' out of the
	TCL_LOCATION_BC branch to after the switch, this is common to all
	frame types. Updated the testsuite to match. This was exposed by the
	2008-06-08 commit (Miguel), switching uplevel from direct eval to
	compilation. [Bug 1987851]

2008-06-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tests/ioTrans.test (iortrans-11.*): Fixed same issue as for
	iortrans.tf-11.*, cleanup of temp file, making this a followup to the
	entry on 2008-06-10 by myself.

2008-06-13  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/rules.vc: SYMBOLS macro is now being set to zero when $(OPTS) is
	not available.
	* win/makefile.vc: The Stubs source files (tclStubLib.c and
	tclOOStubLib.c) should not be compiled with the -GL flag.

2008-06-13  Joe Mistachkin  <joe@mistachkin.com>

	TIP #285 IMPLEMENTATION

	* doc/Eval.3: Added documentation for the Tcl_CancelEval and
	Tcl_Canceled functions and the TCL_CANCEL_UNWIND flag bit.
	* doc/after.n: Corrected the spelling of 'canceled' in the
	documentation.
	* doc/interp.n: Added documentation for [interp cancel].
	* generic/tcl.decls: Added the Tcl_CancelEval and Tcl_Canceled
	functions to the stubs table.
	* generic/tcl.h: Added the TCL_CANCEL_UNWIND flag bit.
	* generic/tclBasic.c: The bulk of the script cancellation
	functionality is defined here. Added code to initialize and manage the
	script cancellation hash table in a thread-safe manner. Reset script
	cancellation flags prior to increasing the nesting level (if the
	nesting level is currently zero) and always cooperatively check for
	script cancellation near the start of TclEvalObjvInternal and after
	invoking async handlers.
	* generic/tclDecls.h: Regenerated.
	* generic/tclEvent.c: Call TclFinalizeEvaluation during finalization
	to cleanup the script cancellation hash table. During [vwait], always
	cooperatively check for script cancellation. Corrected the spelling of
	'canceled' in comments to be consistent with the documentation.
	* generic/tclExecute.c: Reset script cancellation flags prior to
	increasing the nesting level (if the nesting level is currently zero)
	and always cooperatively check for script cancellation after invoking
	async handlers. Prevent [catch] from catching script cancellation when
	the TCL_CANCEL_UNWIND flag is set (similar to the manner used by TIP
	143 when a limit has been exceeded).
	* generic/tclInt.decls: Added TclResetCancellation to the internal
	stubs table.
	* generic/tclInt.h: Added asyncCancel and asyncCancelMsg fields to the
	private Interp structure. Added private interp flag value CANCELED to
	help control script cancellation.
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h: Regenerated.
	* generic/tclInterp.c (Tcl_InterpObjCmd): Added [interp cancel]
	subcommand.
	* generic/tclNotify.c (Tcl_DeleteEventSource): Corrected the spelling
	of 'canceled' in comments to be consistent with the documentation.
	* generic/tclParse.c: Reset script cancellation flags prior to
	* generic/tclProc.c: increasing the nesting level (if the nesting
	level is currently zero) and cooperatively check for script
	cancellation prior to evaluating commands.
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: Regenerated.
	* generic/tclThreadTest.c (Tcl_ThreadObjCmd): Added script
	cancellation support ([testthread cancel]).
	Modified [testthread id] to allow querying of the 'main' thread ID.
	Corrected comments to reflect the actual command syntax. Made
	[testthread wait] cooperatively check for script cancellation. Added
	[testthread event] to allow for processing one pending event without
	blocking.
	* generic/tclTimer.c: Delay for a maximum of 500 milliseconds prior to
	checking for async handlers and script cancellation.
	* tests/cmdAH.test: Changed [interp c] to [interp create].
	* tests/interp.test: Added and fixed tests for [interp cancel].
	* tests/thread.test: Added tests for script cancellation via
	[testthread cancel].
	* tools/man2help2.tcl: Fixed problems with WinHelp target (see
	* tools/man2tcl.c: [Bug 1934200], [Bug 1934265], and [Bug 1934272]).
	* win/makefile.vc: Added 'pdbs' option for Windows build rules to
	* win/rules.vc:	   allow for non-debug builds with full symbols.
	* win/tcl.hpj.in: Corrected version for WinHelp target.
	* win/tclWinNotify.c: Used SleepEx and WaitForSingleObjectEx on
	* win/tclWinThrd.c: Windows because they are alertable.

	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.59

	* macosx/Tcl.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:	add tclIORTrans.c; updates and
						cleanup for Xcode 3.1/Leopard.
	* macosx/Tcl.xcode/project.pbxproj:	sync Tcl.xcodeproj changes.
	* macosx/README:			document new build configs.

2008-06-10  Joe English	 <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclEncoding.c(UtfToUtfProc): Avoid unwanted sign extension
	when converting incomplete UTF-8 sequences. See [Bug 1908443] for
	details.

2008-06-10  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tests/ioTrans.test (iortrans.tf-6.1): Fixed the [Bug 1988552],
	reported by Kevin. Have to close the channel before removal of the
	file. Fixed same bug in test 'iortrans.tf-11.0', after fixing missing
	cleanup of the file in 'iortrans.tf-11.*'. Lastly fixed the names of
	the threaded tests 'iortrans-8.*' to the correct 'iortrans.tf-8.*'.

2008-06-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIORTrans.c (ReflectInput): Fixed a bug triggered by Pat
	Thoyts <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>. Reset the EOF flag after
	draining the Tcl level into the result buffer, to make sure that the
	result buffer will be drained as well by repeated calls to
	ReflectInput should it contain more than one buffer-full of data.
	Without that reset the higher I/O system will not call on ReflectInput
	anymore due to the assumed EOF, thus losing the data which did not fit
	in the buffer of the call which caused the eof and drain.

2008-06-09  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOOCall.c (TclOOGetSortedMethodList): Plug memory leak
	that occurred when all methods were hidden. [Bug 1987817]

2008-06-08  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	   Compilation of uplevel scripts, allow
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c:   non-body compiled scripts to access the
	* generic/tclCompile.c:	   LVT (but not to extend it) and enable the
	* generic/tclCompile.h:	   canonical list opt to sidestep the
	* generic/tclExecute.c:	   compiler. This is [Patch 1973096]
	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* tests/uplevel.test:

2008-06-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	TIP #230 IMPLEMENTATION

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c: Integration of transform commands into 'chan'
			      ensemble.
	* generic/tclInt.h: Definitions of the transform commands.
	* generic/tclIORTrans.c: Implementation of the reflection transforms.
	* tests/chan.test:  Tests updated for new sub-commands of 'chan'.
	* tests/ioCmd.test: Tests updated for new sub-commands of 'chan'.
	* tests/ioTrans.test: Whole new set of tests for the reflection
			      transform.
	* unix/Makefile.in: Integration of new files into build rules.
	* win/Makefile.in:  Integration of new files into build rules.
	* win/makefile.vc:  Integration of new files into build rules.

	NOTE: The file 'tclIORTrans.c' has a lot of code in common with the
	      file 'tclIORChan.c', as that made it much easier to develop the
	      reference implementation as a separate module. Now that the
	      transforms have been committed the one thing left to do is to go
	      over both modules and see which of the common parts we can
	      factor out and share.

2008-06-04  Pat Thoyts	<patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBinary.c: TIP #317 implementation
	* tests/binary.test:

2008-06-02  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclOO.c (ReleaseClassContents): Fix the one remaining
	valgrind complaint about oo.test, caused by failing to protect the
	Object as well as the Class corresponding to a subclass being deleted
	and hence getting a freed-memory read when attempting to delete the
	class command. [Bug 1981001]

2008-06-01  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOOMethod.c (Tcl_NewMethod): Complete the fix of [Bug
	1981001], previous fix was incomplete though helpful in telling me
	where to look.

2008-06-01  Joe Mistachkin  <joe@mistachkin.com>

	* win/Makefile.in: Add tclOO genstubs to Windows makefiles and remove
	* win/makefile.vc: -DBUILD_tcloo because it is no longer required.

2008-06-01  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclOODecls.h:	   Added the swizzling of DLLEXPORT and
	* generic/tclOOIntDecls.h: DLLIMPORT needed to make EXTERN work.

	* generic/tclDictObj.c:	   Added missing initializers to the ensemble
				   map to silence a compiler warning. Thanks
				   to George Peter Staplin for the report.

	* generic/tclOOMethod.c:   Fix a bug where the refcount of a method
				   was reset if the method was redefined while
				   there was an active invocation.
				   [Bug 1981001]

2008-06-01  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOO.decls, unix/Makefile.in (genstubs): Make generation of
	stub tables correct.
	* generic/tclOO{Decls.h,IntDecls.h,StubInit.c,StubLib.c}: Fixes to
	make the generation work correctly, removing subtle differences
	between output of different versions of stub generator.

2008-06-01  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclOOStubLib.c:	ensure use of tcl stubs; include in
	* unix/Makefile.in:		stub lib; disable broken tclOO
					genstubs

	* generic/tclOO.c:		make tclOO stubs tables 'static const'
	* generic/tclOODecls.h:		and stub table pointers MODULE_SCOPE
	* generic/tclOOIntDecls.h:	(change generated files manually
	* generic/tclOOStubInit.c:	pending genstubs support for tclOO).
	* generic/tclOOStubLib.c:

	* generic/tclOO.c:		fix warnings for 'int<->ptr
	* generic/tclOOCall.c:		conversion' and 'signed vs unsigned
	* generic/tclOOMethod.c:	comparison'.

	* tests/msgcat.test:	fix for ::tcl::mac::locale with @modifier.

	* tools/tsdPerf.tcl:	use [info sharedlibextension]

	* unix/tclConfig.h.in:	autoheader-2.59

	* macosx/Tcl.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:	add new tclOO files; add debug
	* macosx/README:			configs with corefoundation
						disabled and with gcov; update
						to Xcode 3.1.

2008-05-31  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOO.c (InitFoundation): Correct reference counting for
	strings used when creating the constructor for classes.
	* generic/tclOOMethod.c (TclOODelMethodRef): Correct fencepost error
	in reference counting of method implementation structures.
	* tests/oo.test (oo-0.5): Added a test to detect a memory leak problem
	relating to disposal of the core object system.

	TIP#257 IMPLEMENTATION

	* generic/tclBasic.c, generic/tclOOInt.h: Correct declarations.
	* win/Makefile.in, win/makefile.bc, win/makefile.vc: Build support for
	Win32, from Joe Mistachkin. [Patch 1980861]

	* generic/tclOO*, doc/*, tests/oo.test: Port of implementation of
	TclOO to sit directly inside Tcl. Note that this is incomplete (e.g.
	no build support yet for Windows).

2008-05-26  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/io.test (io-53.9): need to close chan before removing file.

2008-05-26  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* win/makefile.bc:		    Remove deprecated winhelp target.
	* win/Makefile.in, win/makefile.vc: It didn't work correctly anyway.

2008-05-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* win/tclWinChan.c (FileWideSeekProc): Accepted a patch by Alexandre
	Ferrieux <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net> to fix the [Bug 1965787].
	'tell' now works for locations > 2 GB as well instead of going
	negative.

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_SetChannelBufferSize): Accepted a patch by
	* tests/io.test: Alexandre Ferrieux <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>
	* tests/chanio.test: to fix the [Bug 1969953]. Buffersize outside of
	the supported range are now clipped to nearest boundary instead of
	ignored.

2008-05-22  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (Tcl_LogCommandInfo):	Restored ability to
	handle the argument value length = -1. Thanks to Chris Darroch for
	discovering the bug and providing the fix. [Bug 1968245]

2008-05-21  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclParse.c (ParseComment):	The new TclParseAllWhiteSpace
	* tests/parse.test (parse-15.60):	routine has no mechanism to
	return the "incomplete" status of "\\\n" so calling this routine
	anywhere that can be reached within a Tcl_ParseCommand() call is a
	mistake. In particular, ParseComment() must not use it. [Bug 1968882]

2008-05-20  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (Tcl_SetNamespaceUnknownHandler): Corrected odd
	logic for handling installation of namespace unknown handlers which
	could lead too very strange things happening in the error case.

2008-05-16  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c: fix crash with tcl_traceExec. Found and fixed
	by Alexander Pasadyn. [Bug 1964803]

2008-05-15  Pat Thoyts	<patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/makefile.vc: We should use the thread allocator for threaded
	* win/rules.vc:	   builds. Added 'tclalloc' option to disable.

2008-05-09  George Peter Staplin  <georgeps@xmission.com>
	* tools/tsdPerf.c	A loadable Tcl extension for testing TSD
	performance.
	* tools/tsdPerf.tcl	A simplistic tool that uses the thread
	extension and tsdPerf.so to get some performance metrics by,
	simulating, simple TSD contention.

2008-05-09  George Peter Staplin  <georgeps@xmission.com>

	* generic/tcl.h:	Make Tcl_ThreadDataKey a void *.
	* generic/tclInt.h:	Change around some function names and add some
	new per-platform declarations for thread-specific data functions.
	* generic/tclThread.c:	Make use of of the new function names that no
	longer have a Tclp prefix.
	* generic/tclThreadStorage.c: Replace the core thread-specific data
	(TSD) mechanism with an array offset solution that eliminates the hash
	tables, and only uses one slot of native TSD. Many thanks to Kevin B.
	Kenny for his help with this.

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c:	Add platform-specific TSD functions for use by
	* win/tclWinThrd.c:	tclThreadStorage.c.

2008-05-09  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/dict.test (dict-19.2): Corrected a bug where the test was
	changed to use [apply] instead of a temporary proc, but the cleanup
	script still attempted to delete the temporary proc.

2008-05-07  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@cspool38.cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileDictAppendCmd): Fix silly off-by
	one error that caused a crash every time a compiled 'dict append' with
	more than one argument was used. Found by Colin McCormack.

2008-05-02  Pat Thoyts	<patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	 Converted the [binary] command into an
	* generic/tclBinary.c:	 ensemble.
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* test/binary.test:	 Updated the error tests for ensemble errors.

	* generic/tclFileName.c: Reverted accidental commit of TIP 316 APIs.

2008-04-27  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* */*.c: A large tranche of getting rid of pre-C89-isms; if your
	compiler doesn't support things like proper function declarations,
	'void' and 'const', borrow a proper one when building Tcl. (The header
	files allow building things that link against Tcl with really ancient
	compilers still; the requirement is just when building Tcl itself.)

2008-04-26  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclAsync.c: Tcl_AsyncDelete(): panic if attempt to locate
	handler token fails. Happens when some other thread attempts to delete
	somebody else's token.

	Also, panic early if we find out the wrong thread attempting to delete
	the async handler (common trap). As, only the one that created the
	handler is allowed to delete it.

2008-04-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tests/ioCmd.test: Extended testsuite for reflected channel
	implementation. Added test cases about how it handles if the rug is
	pulled out from under a channel (= killing threads, interpreters
	containing the tcl command for a channel, and channel sitting in a
	different interpreter/thread.)

	* generic/tclIORChan.c: Fixed the bugs exposed by the new testcases,
	redone most of the cleanup and exit handling.

2008-04-21  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:		Removed all code delimited by
	* generic/tclTest.c:		USE_OBSOLETE_FS_HOOKS, completing
	* tests/ioCmd.test:		the deprecation path for these
	* tests/ioUtil.test (removed):	obsolete interfaces. (Code was active
	in Tcl 8.4, present but enabled only by customized compile switch in
	Tcl 8.5, and now completely gone for Tcl 8.6). Also removed all tests
	relevant only to the removed interfaces.

2008-04-19  George Peter Staplin <georgeps@xmission.com>

	* doc/Ensemble.3: Fix a typo: s/defiend/defined/
	Thanks to hat0 for spotting this.

2008-04-16  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:		make stubs tables 'static const' and
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:	export only module-scope pointers to
	* generic/tclStubLib.c:		the main stubs tables (for package
	* tools/genStubs.tcl:		initialization). [Patch 1938497]
	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_CreateInterp):
	* generic/tclTomMathInterface.c (TclTommath_Init):

	* generic/tclInt.h:		revise Tcl_SetNotifier() to use a
	* generic/tclNotify.c:		module-scope hooks table instead of
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:	runtime stubs-table modification;
	* macosx/tclMacOSXNotify.c:	ensure all hookable notifier functions
	* win/tclWinNotify.c:		check for hooks; remove hook checks in
	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c:		notifier API callers. [Patch 1938497]

2008-04-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (CopyData):	Applied another patch by Alexandre
	* io.test (io-53.8a):		Ferrieux <ferrieux@users.sf.net>,
	* chanio.test (chan-io-53.8a):	to shift EOF handling to the async
	part of the command if a callback is specified, should the channel be
	at EOF already when fcopy is called. Testcase by myself.

2008-04-15  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:	adjust tclDTrace.h dependencies for removal
				of tclStubLib.o from TCL_OBJS. [Bug 1942795]

2008-04-14  Kevin B. Kenny <kennykb@acm.org>

	* unix/tclUnixTime.c (NativeGetTime): Removed obsolete use of
	'struct timezone' in the call to 'gettimeofday'. [Bug 1942197]

	* tests/clock.test (clock-33.5, clock-33.5a, clock-33.8, clock-33.8a):
	Added comments to the test that it can fail on a heavily loaded
	system.

2008-04-10  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c (Tcl_FcopyObjCmd): Keeping check for negative
	values, changed to not be an error, but behave like the special value
	-1 (copy all, default).

	* tests/iocmd.test (iocmd-15.{12,13}): Removed.

	* tests/io.test (io-52.5{,a,b}): Reverted last change, added
	* tests/chanio.test (chan-io-52.5{,a,b}): comment regarding the
	meaning of -1, added two more testcases for other negative values,
	and input wrapped to negative.

2008-04-09  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* tests/{fCmd,unixFCmd,winFCmd,winFile}.test: Tidying up of the test
	suite to make better use of tcltest2 and be clearer about what is
	being tested.

	* win/Makefile.in (html): Added target for doing convenient
	documentation builds, mirroring the one from unix/Makefile.

2008-04-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tests/chanio.test (chan-io-52.5): Removed '-size -1' from test,
	* tests/io.test (io-52.5): does not seem to have any bearing, and was
	an illegal value. Test case is not affected by the value of -size,
	test flag restoration and that evrything was properly copied.

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c (Tcl_FcopyObjCmd): Added checking of -size value
	* tests/ioCmd.test (iocmd-15.{13,14}): to reject negative values, and
	values overflowing 32-bit signed. Basic patch by Alexandre Ferrieux
	<ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>, with modifications from me to
	separate overflow from true negative value. Extended testsuite. [Bug
	1557855]

2008-04-09  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/chanio.test (chan-io-53.8,53.9,53.10): Fix typo & quoting for
	* tests/io.test (io-53.8,53.9,53.10):	       spaces in builddir path

2008-04-08  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Added comments to the alignment macros used in
	GrowEvaluationStack() and friends.

2008-04-08  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tools/genStubs.tcl:	Revert erroneous 2008-04-02 change marking
				*StubsPtr as EXTERN instead of extern.

	* generic/tclDecls.h:	make genstubs
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclTomMathDecls.h:

2008-04-07  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tests/io.test (io-53.10): Testcase for bi-directional fcopy.
	* tests/chanio.test:
	* generic/tclIO.c: Additional changes to data structures for fcopy and
	* generic/tclIO.h: channels to perform proper cleanup in case of a
	channel having two background copy operations running as is now
	possible.

	* generic/tclIO.c (BUSY_STATE, CheckChannelErrors, TclCopyChannel):
	New macro, and the places using it. This change allows for
	bi-directional fcopy on channels. Thanks to Alexandre Ferrieux
	<ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net> for the patch. [Bug 1350564]

2008-04-07  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c (Tcl_AppendFormatToObj): Fix [format {% d}]
	so that it behaves the same way as in 8.4 and as C's printf().
	* tests/format.test: Add a test for '% d' and '%+d'.

2008-04-05  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/tclWinFile.c: (WinSymLinkDirectory): Fixed a problem that Tcl
	was creating an NTFS junction point (IO_REPARSE_TAG_MOUNT_POINT) but
	filling in the union member for a Vista symbolic link. We had gotten
	away with this error because the union member
	(SymbolicLinkReparseBuffer) was misdefined in this file and in the
	'winnt.h' in early versions of MinGW. MinGW 3.4.2 has the correct
	definition of SymbolicLinkReparseBuffer, exposing the mismatch, and
	making tests cmdAH-19.4.1, fCmd-28.*, and filename-11.* fail.
	* tests/chanio.test (chan-io-53.9):
	* tests/io.test (io-53.9): Made test cleanup robust against the
	possibility of slow process shutdown on Windows.

	* win/tcl.m4: Added -D_CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE and
	-DCRT_NONSTDC_NO_DEPRECATE to the MSVC compilation flags so that the
	compilation doesn't barf on perfectly reasonable Posix system calls.
	* win/configure: Manually patched (don't have the right autoconf to
	hand).

2008-04-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tests/io.test (io-53.9): Added testcase for [Bug 780533], based
	* tests/chanio.test: on Alexandre's test script. Also fixed problem
	with timer in preceding test, was not canceled properly in the ok case

2008-04-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIORChan.c (ReflectOutput): Allow zero return from write
	when input was zero-length anyway. Otherwise keept it an error, and
	separate the message from 'written too much'.

	* tests/ioCmd.test (iocmd-24.6): Testcase updated for changed message.

	* generic/tclIORChan.c (ReflectClose): Added missing removal of the
	now closed channel from the reflection map. Before we could crash the
	system by invoking 'chan postevent' on a closed reflected channel,
	dereferencing the dangling pointer in the map.

	* tests/ioCmd.test (iocmd-31.8): Testcase for the above.

2008-04-03  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (CopyData): Applied patch [Bug 1932639] to
	* tests/io.test: prevent fcopy from calling -command synchronously
	* tests/chanio.test: the first time. Thanks to Alexandre Ferrieux
	<ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net> for report and patch.

2008-04-02  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.decls:	remove 'export' declarations of symbols now
				only in libtclstub and no longer in libtcl.

	* generic/tclStubLib.c:	make symbols in libtclstub.a MODULE_SCOPE to
	* tools/genStubs.tcl:	avoid exporting them from libraries that link
				with -ltclstub; constify tcl*StubsPtr and stub
				table hook pointers. [Bug 1819422]

2008-04-02  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (CopyData): Applied patch for fcopy problem [Bug
	780533], with many thanks to Alexandre Ferrieux
	<ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net> for tracking it down and providing a
	solution. Still have to convert his test script into a proper test
	case.

2008-04-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclStrToD.c: Applied patch for [Bug 1839067] (fp rounding
	* unix/tcl.m4:	       setup on solaris x86, native cc), provided by

	* tools/genStubs.tcl:	creation so that "tclStubsPtr" is not present
	* unix/Makefile.in:	in libtcl.so, but is present only in
	* win/Makefile.in:	libtclstub.a. This tightens up the rules for
	* win/makefile.bc:	users of the stubs interfaces. [Bug 1819422]
	* win/makefile.vc:

2008-03-30  Kevin Kenny	 <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclInt.h (TclIsNaN):
	* unix/configure.in: Added code to the configurator to check for a
			     standard isnan() macro and use it if one is
			     found. This change avoids bugs where the test of
			     ((d) != (d)) is optimized away by an
			     overaggressive compiler. [Bug 1783544]
	* generic/tclObj.c: Added missing #include <math.h> needed to locate
			    isnan() after the above change.

	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.61

	* tests/mathop.test (mathop-25.9, mathop-25.14): Modified tests to
	deal with (slightly buggy) math libraries in which pow() returns an
	incorrectly rounded result. [Bug 1808174]

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SunOS-5.1x): fix 64bit support for Sun cc. [Bug 1921166]

	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.59

2008-03-26  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes:		Updated for 8.5.2 release.

2008-03-24  Pat Thoyts	<patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBinary.c: [Bug 1923966] - crash in binary format
	* tests/binary.test:   Added tests for the above crash condition.

2008-03-21  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/switch.n: Clarified documentation in respect of two-argument
	invokation. [Bug 1899962]

	* tests/switch.test: Added more tests of regexp-mode compilation of
	the [switch] command. [Bug 1854435]

2008-03-20  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tcl.h, generic/tclThreadAlloc.c: Tidied up the declarations
	of Tcl_GetMemoryInfo so that it is always defined. Will panic when
	called against a Tcl that was previously built without it at all,
	which is OK because that also indicates a serious mismatch between
	memory configuration options.

2008-03-19  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tcl.h, generic/tclThreadAlloc.c (Tcl_GetMemoryInfo): Make
	sure this function is available when direct linking. [Bug 1868171]

	* tests/reg.test (reg-33.14): Marked nonPortable because some
	environments have small default stack sizes. [Bug 1905562]

2008-03-18  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* library/tm.tcl (::tcl::tm::UnknownHandler): Changed 'source' to
	'source -encoding utf-8'. This fixes a portability problem of Tcl
	Modules pointed out by Don Porter. By using plain 'source' we were at
	the mercy of 'encoding system', making modules less portable than they
	could be. The exact scenario: A writes a TM in some weird encoding
	which is A's system encoding, distributes it, and somewhere else it
	cannot be read/used because the system encoding is different. Forcing
	the use of utf-8 makes the module portable.

	***INCOMPATIBILITY*** for all Tcl Modules already written in non-utf-8
	compatible encodings.

2008-03-18  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c:	Patch from Miguel Sofer to correct the
	alignment of memory allocated by GrowEvaluationStack(). [Bug 1914503]

2008-03-18  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* library/tm.tcl (::tcl::tm::Defaults): Modified handling of
	environment variables. Solution slightly different than proposed in
	the report. Using the underscored form TCLX_y_TM_PATH even if
	TCLX.y_TM_PATH exists. Also using a loop to cut prevent code
	replication. [Bug 1914604]

2008-03-16  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileDictForCmd): Correct the handling
	of stack space calculation (the jump pattern used was confusing the
	simple-minded code doing the calculations). [Bug 1903325]

	* doc/lreplace.n: Clarified documentation of what happens with
	negative indices. [Bug 1905809] Added example, tidied up formatting.

2008-03-14  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (OldMathFuncProc):	Same workaround protection
	from bad TclStackAlloc() alignment. Thanks George Peter Staplin.

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (Tcl_LsortObjCmd):	Use ckalloc() to allocate
	SortElement arrays instead of TclStackAlloc() which isn't getting
	alignment right. Workaround for [Bug 1914503].

2008-03-14  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* generic/tclTest.c:  Ignore the return value of write() when we are
	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c: about to exit anyways.

2008-03-13  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure.in: Use backslash-quoting instead of double-quoting
	* unix/tcl.m4:	     for lib paths in tclConfig.sh. [Bug 1913622]
	* unix/configure:    autoconf-2.59

2008-03-13  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes:		Updated for 8.5.2 release.

	* macosx/Tcl-Common.xcconfig:		'xcodebuild install'.

2008-03-12  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* doc/info.n: Replaced {expand} with {*}.

2008-03-12  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in (install-libraries):	Bump http to 2.7
	* win/Makefile.in (install-libraries):	Added -myaddr option to allow
	* library/http/http.tcl (http::geturl):	control of selected socket
	* library/http/pkgIndex.tcl:		interface. [Bug 559898]
	* doc/http.n, tests/http.test:		Added -keepalive and
	-protocol 1.1 with chunked transfer encoding support. [Bug 1063703,
	1470377, 219225] (default keepalive is 0)
	Added ability to override Host in -headers. [Bug 928154]
	Added -strict option to control URL validation on per-call basis.
	[Bug 1560506]

2008-03-11  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/http.n:				[Bug 1599901, 862554]

	* library/http/http.tcl: Whitespace changes, code cleanup. Allow http
	to be re-sourced without overwriting http state.

2008-03-11  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclEncoding.c (LoadEscapeEncoding): Avoid leaking escape
	sub-encodings, fixes encoding-11.1 failing after iso2022-jp loaded.
	[Bug 1893053]

	* macosx/tclMacOSXNotify.c: Avoid using CoreFoundation after fork() on
	Darwin 9 even when TclpCreateProcess() uses vfork().

	* macosx/Tcl.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:	Add support for Xcode 3.1 and
	* macosx/Tcl.xcodeproj/default.pbxuser:	configs for building with
	* macosx/Tcl-Common.xcconfig:		gcc-4.2 and llvm-gcc-4.2.

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:			Workaround vfork() problems in
						llvm-gcc-4.2.1 -O4 build.

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:			Move MODULE_SCOPE compat
						define to top. [Bug 1911102]

	* macosx/GNUmakefile:			Fix quoting to allow paths
	* macosx/Tcl-Common.xcconfig:		to ${builddir} and
	* unix/Makefile.in:			${INSTALL_ROOT} to contain
	* unix/configure.in:			spaces.
	* unix/install-sh:
	* unix/tcl.m4:

	* tests/exec.test (exec-9.7):		Reduce timing sensitivity
	* tests/socket.test (socket-2.11):	(esp. on multi-proc machines).

	* tests/fCmd.test (fCmd-9.4):		Skip on Darwin 9 (xfail).

2008-03-11  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c (TclDeleteNamespaceVars):
	* tests/var.test (var-8.2): Unset traces on vars should be called with
	a FQ named during namespace deletion. This was causing infinite loops
	when unset traces recreated the var, as reported by Julian Noble. [Bug
	1911919]

2008-03-10  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes:		Updated for 8.5.2 release.

	* doc/http.n:	Revised to indicate that [package require http 2.5.5]
	is needed to get all the documented commands ([http::meta]).

	* generic/tclEvent.c (TclDefaultBgErrorHandlerObjCmd):	Added error
	* tests/event.test (event-5.*):	checking to protect against callers
	passing invalid return options dictionaries. [Bug 1901113]

	* generic/tclBasic.c (ExprAbsFunc):	Revised so that the abs()
	* tests/expr.test:	function and the [::tcl::mathfunc::abs]
	command do not return the value of -0, or equivalent values with more
	alarming string reps like -1e-350. [Bug 1893815]

2008-03-07  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclResult.c (ReleaseKeys): Workaround for [Bug 1904907].
	Reset the return option keys to NULL to allow full re-initialization
	by GetKeys(). This introduces a memory leak for the key objects, but
	gets us around a crash in the finalization of reflected channels when
	handling returns, either at compile- or runtime. In both cases we
	access the keys after they have been released by their thread exit
	handler. A proper fix is entangled with the untangling of the
	finalization ordering and attendant issues. For now we choose the
	lesser evil.

2008-03-07  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (Tcl_ExprObj):	Revised expression bytecode
	compiling so that bytecodes invalid due to changing context or due to
	the difference between expressions and scripts are not reused. [Bug
	1899164]

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:	Revised direct evaluation implementation of
	[expr] so that [expr $e] caches compiled bytecodes for the expression
	as the intrep of $e.

	* tests/execute.test (execute-6.*):	More tests checking that
	script bytecode is invalidated in the right situations.

2008-03-07  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* win/configure.in: Add AC_HEADER_STDC to support msys/win64.

2008-03-06  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/namespace.n: Minor tidying up. [Bug 1909019]

2008-03-04  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/execute.test (6.3,4):	Added tests for [Bug 1899164].

2008-03-03  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c: Fix mark and space parity on Linux, which uses
	CMSPAR instead of PAREXT.

2008-03-02  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (GetNamespaceFromObj):
	* tests/interp.test (interp-28.2): Spoil the intrep of an nsNameType
	obj when the reference crosses interpreter boundaries.

2008-02-29  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclResult.c (Tcl_SetReturnOptions):	Revised the refcount
	management of Tcl_SetReturnOptions to become that of a conventional
	Consumer routine. Thanks to Peter Spjuth for pointing out the
	difficulties calling Tcl_SetReturnOptions with non-0-count value for
	options.
	* generic/tclExecute.c (INST_RETURN_STK): Revised the one caller
	within Tcl itself which passes a non-0-count value to
	Tcl_SetReturnOptions().

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_AppendObjToErrorInfo):	Revised the
	refcount management of Tcl_AppendObjToErrorInfo to become that of a
	conventional Consumer routine. This preserves the ease of use for the
	overwhelming common callers who pass in a 0-count value, but makes the
	proper call with a non-0-count value less surprising.
	* generic/tclEvent.c (TclDefaultBgErrorHandlerObjCmd):	Revised the
	one caller within Tcl itself which passes a non-0-count value to
	Tcl_AppendObjToErrorInfo().

2008-02-28  Joe English	 <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclPort.h, unix/tclCompat.h, unix/tclUnixChan.h: Reduce scope
	of <sys/filio.h> and <sys/ioctl.h> #includes. [Patch 1903339]

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c, unix/tclUnixNotfy.c, unix/tclUnixPipe.c:
	Consolidate all code conditionalized on -DUSE_FIONBIO into one place.
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h, unix/tclUnixCompat.c: New routine
	TclUnixSetBlockingMode(). [Patch 1903339]

2008-02-28  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclEvalObjvInternal):	Plug memory leak when
	an enter trace deletes or changes the command, prompting a reparsing.
	Don't let the second pass lose commandPtr value allocated during the
	first pass.

	* generic/tclCompExpr.c (ParseExpr):	Plug memory leak in error
	message generation.

	* generic/tclStringObj.c (Tcl_AppendFormatToObj): [format %llx $big]
	leaked an mp_int.

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileReturnCmd):	The 2007-10-18 commit
	to optimize compiled [return -level 0 $x] [RFE 1794073] introduced a
	memory leak of the return options dictionary. Fixing that.

2008-02-27  Pat Thoyts	<patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/http/http.tcl: [Bug 705956] - fix inverted logic when
	cleaning up socket error in geturl.

2008-02-27  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* doc/clock.n: Corrected minor indentation gaffe in the penultimate
	paragraph. [Bug 1898025]
	* generic/tclClock.c (ParseClockFormatArgs): Changed to check that the
	clock value is in the range of a 64-bit integer. [Bug 1862555]
	* library/clock.tcl (::tcl::clock::format, ::tcl::clock::scan,
	(::tcl::clock::add, ::tcl::clock::LocalizeFormat): Fixed bugs in
	caching of localized strings that caused weird results when localized
	date/time formats were used. [Bug 1902423]
	* tests/clock.test (clock-61.*, clock-62.1): Regression tests for [Bug
	1862555] and [Bug 1902423].

2008-02-26  Joe English	 <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c, unix/tclUnixPort.h, unix/tclUnixChan.c:
	Remove dead/unused portability-related #defines and unused conditional
	code. See [Patch 1901828] for discussion.

2008-02-26  Joe English	 <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIORChan.c (enum MethodName),
	* generic/tclCompExpr.c (enum Marks): More stray trailing ","s

2008-02-26  Joe English	 <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure.in(socklen_t test): Define socklen_t as "int" if
	missing, not "unsigned". Use AC_TRY_COMPILE instead of
	AC_EGREP_HEADER.
	* unix/configure: regenerated.

2008-02-26  Joe English	 <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.h: Remove stray trailing "," from enum
	InstOperandType definition (C99ism).

2008-02-26  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclUtil.c (TclReToGlob): Fix the handling of the last star
	* tests/regexpComp.test:	   possibly being escaped in
	determining right anchor. [Bug 1902436]

2008-02-26  Pat Thoyts	<patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/http/pkgIndex.tcl: Set version 2.5.5
	* library/http/http.tcl:     It is better to do the [eof] check after
	trying to read from the socket. No clashes found in testing. Added
	http::meta command to access the http headers. [Bug 1868845]

2008-02-22  Pat Thoyts	<patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/http/pkgIndex.tcl: Set version 2.5.4

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileSwitchCmd): Corrected logic for
	* tests/switch.test (switch-10.15): handling -nocase compilation; the
	-exact -nocase option cannot be compiled currently. [Bug 1891827]

	* unix/README: Documented missing configure flags. [Bug 1799011]

2008-02-06  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* library/clock.tcl (::tcl::clock::format):
	* tests/clock.test (clock-1.0, clock-1.4):
	Performance enhancements in [clock format] (moving the analysis of
	$args into C code, holding on to Tcl_Objs with resolved command names,
	[lassign] in place of [foreach], avoiding [namespace which] for
	command resolution).
