.SH NAME
concat \- Join lists together
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBconcat\fI \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command joins each of its arguments together with spaces after
trimming leading and trailing white-space from each of them.  If all the
arguments are lists, this has the same effect as concatenating them
into a single list.
It permits any number of arguments;
if no \fIarg\fRs are supplied, the result is an empty string.
.SH EXAMPLES
Although \fBconcat\fR will concatenate lists (so the command:
.CS
\fBconcat\fR a b {c d e} {f {g h}}
.CE
will return
.QW "\fBa b c d e f {g h}\fR"
as its result), it will also
concatenate things that are not lists, and hence the command:
.CS
\fBconcat\fR " a b {c   " d "  e} f"
.CE
will return
.QW "\fBa b {c d e} f\fR"
as its result.
.PP
Note that the concatenation does not remove spaces from the middle of
its arguments, so the command:
.CS
\fBconcat\fR "a   b   c" { d e f }
.CE
will return
.QW "\fBa   b   c d e f\fR"
(i.e. with three spaces between
the \fBa\fR, the \fBb\fR and the \fBc\fR).
