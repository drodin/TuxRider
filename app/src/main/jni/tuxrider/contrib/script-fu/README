This directory contains Gimp script-fu scripts that aid in designing courses.
To install these scripts, place them in your ~/.gimp/scripts or
~/.gimp-1.1/scripts directory and restart Gimp.  Note that some scripts have
separate Gimp 1.0 and 1.1 versions.

All scripts are by Ingo Ruhnke <grumbel@gmx.de>.

Script Descriptions:
--------------------

tuxracer-create-level.scm: creates a new image of the specified size with the
    correct layer names and useful default colours. This is especially useful
    when combined with the following script. The script is accessed using the
    <right-click on image> -> Script-Fu -> Tuxracer -> Save Image as RGBs menu
    item. 

tuxracer-save-as-rgbs-1.0.scm: takes a multi-layer image and saves it as a set
    of RGB images, using the layer names as filenames (e.g., elev, trees,
    terrain). This is very useful for maintaining levels (i.e., create and
    maintain the level as a multi-level .xcf file, and export the separate RGB
    images using this script). There is also a Gimp 1.1 version:
    tuxracer-save-as-rgbs-1.1.scm. The script is accessed using the Xtns ->
    Script-Fu -> Tuxracer -> New Level menu item. 

tuxracer-load-level-1.1.scm: loads an existing level (assuming filenames
    elev.rgb, trees.rgb, terrain.rgb) into a multi-layered image.  
    The script is accessed using the Xtns -> Script-Fu -> Tuxracer -> 
    Load Level menu item.  Note: this script only works with Gimp 1.1.
